                                          Student Enrollment Form

Description:
This form is designed for enrolling students into a school database (SCHOOL-DB). The form will interact with the STUDENT-TABLE relation and manage student records. The primary key for the student records is Roll-No. The form includes functionality to add new student records, update existing ones, and reset the form fields. The primary key ensures the uniqueness of each student entry and is crucial for the operations performed by the form.


Some benifits of this project are :
1) Efficient Data Management:
The form simplifies the process of managing student records by offering an easy-to-use interface for          entering, updating, and resetting data. This streamlines operations and reduces the time and effort needed    to handle student information.

2) Data Integrity and Accuracy:
With Roll-No serving as the primary key, the form guarantees that each student entry is unique. This          approach prevents duplicate records and maintains the accuracy of the database.

3) Scalability:
Designed to handle a growing number of student records, the form can accommodate future expansions without    significant modifications, ensuring it meets the needs of a growing school.

4) User-Friendly Interface:
The form's design is intuitive, featuring clear input fields and control buttons ([Save], [Update],           [Reset]). This makes it simple for users to enter, update, and reset student information with ease.

5) Enhanced Data Security:
By appropriately disabling fields and buttons (e.g., the primary key field after it is filled), the form      enhances data security and prevents unintended modifications to critical data.
